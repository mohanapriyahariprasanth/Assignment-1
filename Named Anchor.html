        <h3> The Story :</h3>
        <p style=" font-size: large; color : blue;">
            Vijay Rajendran, the youngest son of an eminent business magnate, Rajendran Palanisamy, is disowned and thrown out of the house as he refused to join the family business, instead deciding to launch a food delivery startup. Seven years later, Rajendran is diagnosed with advanced-stage pancreatic cancer and has only a few more months to live. He decides to reveal his terminal condition and make one of his two elder sons, Jai or Ajay, as the chairman of the company, before his impending death.
            
            With this in mind, Rajendran plans to celebrate his 65th birthday in a grand manner, with the intention of announcing both matters during the celebration. Vijay is also invited at the behest of his mother Sudha, who still considers him as her son. Vijay arrives only to find his house in disarray. Jai is cheating on his wife, Aarthi, with another woman, Smitha, and neglecting his family in the process, including his teenage daughter, Ria. Ajay owes a huge amount of money to Mukesh, a financier. When he is not able to repay the money, he offers to leak his company's secrets to his father's business rival, Jayaprakash "JP"; the two elder brothers themselves do not speak with each other and constantly fight for being their father's successor.
            
            Meanwhile, Vijay meets Divya, Aarthi's younger sister, who has a crush on Vijay since her childhood. After a few incidents, the duo fall for each other. During Rajendran's birthday celebration, JP and Mukesh reveal the duplicity of Jai and Ajay, which distraughts the entire family, particularly Aarthi, who decides to file for divorce, as well as Rajendran, who has lost a business deal to JP due to Ajay's duplicity. Realising that he cannot rely on his elder sons to run his business empire, Rajendran reaches out to Vijay, who initially refuses, but later agrees to take over the business after learning about Rajendran's illness.
            
            In jealousy and dismay, Jai and Ajay leave the house and join hands with JP and Mukesh to get rid of Vijay as the chairman, but Vijay manages to cross the hurdles and neatly handles the family business. After Vijay rescues Ria from human traffickers, Jai realises his mistakes and reconciles with Vijay, Aarthi, and the rest of the family. Vijay and Jai team up to stop Ajay from selling their company's shares to JP, where they make him realise his mistakes. With the whole family now reunited, they have a hearty meal together, much to the happiness of Rajendran and Sudha. When Rajendran dies, the three brothers perform his funeral together and scatter his ashes in Varanasi. Vijay ends the film by leaving a message that no family is perfect, but everyone has only one family.</p>
